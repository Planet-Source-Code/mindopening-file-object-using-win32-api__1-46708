## File Object Using Win32 API


</div>

### Description

I haven't submitted in a while and figured that some of you might might be able to use some of the things I have worked on. Much of this code was inspired by this site or derived from this site. This submission is a File Object by encapsulating Win API functions into an object oriented dll. I have used this dll in several applications currently distributed in high stress environments. Includes advanced file and directory properties and functions including File Input/Output. And a file searching collection.
